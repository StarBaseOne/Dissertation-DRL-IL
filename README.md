# Deep Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning for Autonomous Driving in a Minimalist Environment
- Dissertation for Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence - University of Limerick - June 2021

Autonomous driving technology has seen significant advancements in recent years, but fully autonomous self-driving cars are yet to be deployed at scale. This study delves into the world of deep reinforcement learning and imitation learning to evaluate their effectiveness in minimalist autonomous driving environments.

## Introduction

Reinforcement learning has been a focal point in autonomous vehicle research, aiming to achieve safe and fully autonomous self-driving cars. However, despite technological breakthroughs, we still primarily see autonomous vehicles in controlled environments ("geofenced") like Waymo One or Tesla's autopilot driver assistance system. The levels of autonomy, ranging from 0 (none) to 5 (full), offer an iterative approach, with levels 1 to 3 being deployed to some extent in real-world scenarios.

This study focuses on assessing various deep reinforcement learning and imitation learning techniques in a set of minimalist autonomous driving environments. These simulations mirror specific driving scenarios akin to the capabilities of systems like Tesla Autopilot. Scenarios include vehicle parking, highway navigation, intersection handling, hairpin turns, overtaking, merging, and summoning the vehicle while avoiding traffic.

## Aims and Objectives

The primary aim of this thesis is to evaluate the performance of deep reinforcement learning, offline reinforcement learning, and imitation learning in challenging driving tasks. We hypothesize that data-driven reinforcement learning, particularly offline and imitation learning, outperforms online reinforcement learning in common challenging driving scenarios.

Our objectives include:

- Measuring rewards and success rates for training completion.
- Evaluating collision avoidance metrics.
- Analyzing the agents' ability to generalize to unseen conditions.

## Literature Review

The literature review in this study covers several key aspects of autonomous vehicle research:

- The current state of autonomous vehicle research.
- The application of deep reinforcement learning on realistic driving simulators.
- Evaluation of deep reinforcement learning against imitation learning.
- In-depth exploration of specific driving scenarios and tasks.
- Safety mechanisms and collision avoidance in autonomous vehicles.
- Experimentation techniques, including evaluation and metric gathering.

By addressing these aspects, we aim to contribute valuable insights to the autonomous driving research community.
